3. My goal for this project is to create a working Lightroom clone. You’ll be able to select a photo and apply adjustments to the image. Lightroom is known for being a nondestructive editing program, meaning that the original image is not altered in any way; the adjustments are stored as a set of instructions that are applied upon export. I intend to copy a lot of the way Lightroom works, including it’s non-destructiveness.
